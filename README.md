Selected R and Stata scripts illustrating the core analyses (Objectives 1–3) for the TEDS study on adolescent body dissatisfaction and mental-health outcomes.

# TEDS Body Dissatisfaction and Mental Health: Exemplar Code
This repository contains exemplar R and Stata scripts used in the paper:

"Longitudinal associations between adolescent body dissatisfaction, eating disorder and depressive symptoms, and BMI: a UK twin cohort study."

Because the TEDS data cannot be shared, the scripts illustrate the analytic workflow only (Objectives 1–3), including:

Objective 1: Mixed-effects models with multiply imputed data (Stata)

Objective 2: Co-twin difference models for eating disorder symptoms (Stata)

Objective 3: ACE/AE/ADE models for body dissatisfaction and eating disorder symptoms (R / OpenMx)

All directory paths have been removed or anonymised. These code snippets are intended as examples of the modelling strategy described in the manuscript, rather than a full reproducible pipeline.
